### YOLOv7 Model Training Documentation for Violence Behavior Detection

#### Introduction
This document outlines the training process of a specialized YOLOv7 model designed to detect violent behavior in various contexts. The model was trained using a dataset specifically curated for distinguishing between violent and non-violent behaviors.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for training was sourced from the [East-West University dataset on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/east-west-uniersity/violance-nonviolance), which consists of 6614 images divided into:

- **Training Set:** 5787 images
- **Validation Set:** 551 images
- **Test Set:** 276 images

This dataset offers a balanced mix of violent and non-violent scenes, providing a comprehensive foundation for the model to learn from.

#### Training Environment
- **Model Base:** YOLOv7
- **Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX 3070
- **Batch Size:** 4
- **Epochs:** 100
- **YOLOv7 Source:** The training script and the pre-trained weights (.pt file) were utilized from the [YOLOv7 official GitHub repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7). The training process was guided by the methodology described in the [Roboflow's YOLOv7 training notebook](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov7-object-detection-on-custom-data.ipynb).

#### Training Procedure

1. **Data Preparation**: The "Violance-Nonviolance" dataset was downloaded and prepared according to YOLOv7's data format requirements.
2. **Environment Setup**: YOLOv7â€™s environment was set up using the instructions provided in the GitHub repository.
3. **Model Training**: The model was trained using the provided `train.py` file and pre-trained `yolov7_training.pt` file from the YOLOv7 repository. Training parameters were set to a batch size of 4 and a total of 100 epochs.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using the validation and test sets.

#### Testing and Results
The model's performance was tested on various videos, showcasing its ability to accurately distinguish between violent and non-violent behaviors.

- **Street Dance Video:** The model successfully identified the high-energy movements of street dancing as non-violent, avoiding false alarms.
- **UFC Video:** During a UFC match, the model accurately detected violent interactions, highlighted by bounding boxes. Notably, these bounding boxes disappeared once the fighting ceased and medical aid was administered, demonstrating the model's precision and reliability.

#### Conclusion
The training of the YOLOv7 model for violence behavior detection has shown promising results in distinguishing between violent and non-violent actions in different scenarios. The model's ability to correctly interpret high-energy, non-violent activities as safe, and accurately identify genuine violent behavior, highlights its potential for real-world applications in surveillance and security systems.

#### Additional Notes
- The trained model files and detailed results will be included in the accompanying documentation.
- This training documentation will form part of a comprehensive README file, providing users with all necessary information for replicating or further developing the model.
